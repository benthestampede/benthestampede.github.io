        <h1>Ben's Big Body</h1>
            <p>Jacob Brown-Man visits his brown cow, which is in pain. Jacob looks at hoof – it is raw. Jacob must cut off hoof. In doing so, it starts a dark portal to Old Kingdom. 
            Prior to conclusion of doorway, Jacob says anti-hi to cow. In Jacob's away, hoof says blood until cow has no spirit. It is a sad day.</p>

            <p>Jacob is in Old Kingdom now. Jacob is afraid. Land has many Ghouls. A ghoul attacks him. Cow spirit is in Jacob now. Jacob attacks with Cow Punch. Ghoul has no spirit now. 
            Jacob's fist is full of ghoul blood. Jacob now has bloodlust. Jacob wants to find an anti-bloodlust potion. Jacob follows a trail until Jacob finds a black building with a Wizard sign.
            Wizard says hi and says his calling is Bro Wizardman IV. Wizard follows Jacob's mind and knows his calling and says hi to Jacob using a thing which is not okay. Jacob says:</p>

            <p>“You cannot call Jacob that. That thing at conclusion of my short calling is not in this book. It is not okay!”</p>

            <p>As Jacob says that, Bro Wizardman IV turns into a cloud of ash. His saying of thing which is not okay has lost his spirit. It is surprising that a wizard did not know that. 
            But Old Kingdom is an odd land.</p>

            <p>Jacob is sad about his loss of cow and Bro Wizardman IV. It is a much sad day. On a happy saying, Jacob finds an anti-bloodlust potion in building. 
            Jacob drinks it, but it has a bonus thing – it turns Jacob's skin from brown to indigo. Jacob is an Indigo-Man now; Jacob is indigo, da ba day da ba diy. Jacob parts ways with black building.</p>

            <p>Jacob looks at Old Kingdom. Sky is black, land is brown. Ghouls look gray. Jacob sticks out with his indigo skin. Jacob thinks about that and is sad that potion is in him, but glad for no bloodlust.

            <p>It starts to rain black drops. Ghouls turn skulls up to sky and drink rain with black maws. It is both an ugly and anti-ugly sight. 
            Jacob knows a stirring in his blood and with ghouls busy, follows trail to woods. Wood-growth is gray, with only trunks, limbs and sticks - a good hiding spot for ghouls. 
            Jacob Indigo-Man holds his cow-fists up for anti-attack.</p>

            <p>Walking slowly and looking around, Jacob follows a woodland path. Small black drops of rain and scary sounds pass through wood-growth. 
            Jacob finds a big round spot of brown ground with no ghouls in sight. Big black raindrops fall on his indigo skin as Jacob visits a big stump of wood-growth and finds indigo blossoms around it. 
            Jacob sits on trunk and picks a blossom with his non-bloody, non-right hand. This is first location in Old Kingdom that brings Jacob many happy thoughts.</p>

            <p>Moist drops from Jacob's sight balls mix with rain.</p>
