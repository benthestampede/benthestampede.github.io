            Hi! My name is Ben Davenport and I am practicing my web development skills here. You can find links to my music and coding projects below, plus some silly (and super serious) writing I've done.
            I currently work at an after-school program (kids are the best!) while pursuing my creative projects on the side. Below is a (very exciting) action shot of me cleaning up.
